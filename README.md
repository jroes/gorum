# Gorum

Gorum is a forum written in Go. We want it to be:

* Lightweight - it should take up minimal resources (RAM, CPU) so it could be functional in a cheap-ass shared environment.
* Fast - because fast is cool, and using slow forums is painful
* Simple - it should take basically no time to set up, requiring minimal external dependencies
